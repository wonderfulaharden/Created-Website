<h1>Mimic a Printed Advertisement</h1>
<div>
This required me to find a simple advertisement in print. I wrote HTML and CSS to mimic the look of that page as closely as possible while also making adjustments that are allowed by the web. I also wrote a paper that included both my HTML and CSS displayed in color, well formatted and in Courier New. This also included various challenges I met to accomplish the goal. Following that I included a brief discussion of my thoughts on the assignment and submitted the paper on Moodle.
